    "\n",
    "* #### Eigenvalue Decomposition:\n",
    "    PCA proceeds with eigenvalue decomposition (or singular value decomposition) of the covariance matrix. This decomposition yields a set \n",

    "\n",
    "* #### Eigenvectors as Principal Components:\n",
    "    The eigenvectors represent directions (principal components) in the original feature space along which the data varies. These principal \n",

    "\n",
    "* #### Eigenvalues and Explained Variance:\n",
    "    The eigenvalues associated with the eigenvectors quantify the amount of variance in the data explained by each principal component. \n",
    "    Larger eigenvalues indicate that the corresponding principal components capture more of the data's variance, while smaller eigenvalues \n",

    "    The goal of PCA is to maximize the variance of the data when projected onto each principal component. In other words, PCA seeks the\n",
    "    directions (principal components) that capture the maximum spread or variability in the data. This is done by choosing the eigenvectors \n",

    "* #### Explained Variance Ratio:\n",
    "    PCA often reports the proportion of the total variance explained by each principal component. This is known as the explained variance\n",

    "PCA effectively handles data with high variance in some dimensions but low variance in others by identifying and emphasizing the directions\n",

    "\n",
    "* ##### Emphasizing High Variance Dimensions:\n",
    "    PCA identifies the principal components by maximizing the variance of the data when projected onto these components. Therefore, if some\n",
    "    dimensions have high variance, PCA will naturally prioritize capturing this high variance. The first principal component is the direction\n",
    "    that captures the most variance in the data, even if other dimensions have low variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Orthogonality of Principal Components:\n",
    "    Principal components, by definition, are orthogonal (uncorrelated) to each other. This means that if one principal component captures the\n",
    "    high variance along one set of dimensions, subsequent principal components will capture the remaining variance orthogonal to the earlier\n",
    "    components. As a result, PCA doesn't \"mix\" the high and low variance dimensions; it separates them into different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "    PCA allows for dimensionality reduction by retaining only a subset of the principal components that explain the most variance. If some \n",
    "    dimensions have low variance and are less informative, PCA may effectively exclude them from the selected principal components, reducing \n",
    "    the dimensionality of the data.\n",

    "* ##### Information Retention:\n",
    "    While PCA emphasizes high variance dimensions, it also seeks to retain the most essential information in the data. If low variance\n",
    "    dimensions contain relevant information or are necessary for the analysis, PCA will still consider them, especially if they collectively\n",
    "    contribute to a significant portion of the total variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### Varied Spread of Principal Components:\n",
    "    The principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they capture, with the first component explaining the most variance, the\n",
    "    second explaining the second most, and so on. High variance dimensions contribute to the larger eigenvalues associated with the earlier \n",
    "    principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, PCA naturally handles data with varying levels of variance in different dimensions. It identifies and prioritizes the directions \n",
    "with the highest variance, allowing it to capture the essential patterns and structures in the data. Low variance dimensions are not ignored\n",
    "but are represented by subsequent principal components that capture the remaining variance orthogonal to the high variance dimensions. \n",
    "This property of PCA makes it suitable for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, especially in cases where some dimensions are\n",
    "more informative than others."
